    <h1>Crimes in Chicago(2012-2016)</h1>
    <p>This project is to use an interactive slideshow to illustrate the patterns of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago">Chicago Crime.</a></p>
    <p>The ‘Crimes in Chicago’ dataset is obtained from Kaggle, released by Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. The aim of this assignment is to analyze and visualize crime patterns during year 2012-2016. The downloaded csv file contains crime full records from 2012-2016 as well as January 2017, to prepare the data, I filtered out 2017 data using Python.</p>
    <h2>Narrative Visualization with Scenes</h2>
    <p>This slideshow aims at leading users to discover interesting facts about crimes in Chicago city during 2012-2016.</p>
    <p>1. Scene 1: The overall monthly crime incidence. This interactive multi-line graph shows monthly crime incidence as well as the comparison among years, which gives user an overview of this dataset. This scene naturally leads to a follow up question that will be answered in next scene.</p>
    <p>2. Scene 2: The percentile of crime types grouped by each year. This interactive donut chart shows crime type percentage change during these years. User can select 'year' as parameter, to investigate which crime types undergo significant change. This also leads to the hypothesis that: The reduced incidences of some crime types is due to high arrest rate. We will investigate this hypothesis in next scene.</p> 
    <p>3. Scene 3: The arrest rate of each crime type. This sorted bar chart helps user to investigate the hypothesis dedrived from last scene. User can look up if the crime type that reduced significantly has high arrest rate, and vise versa.</p>
    <p>To conclude, this narrative visualization used 3 interactive scenes to demonstrate the information I found in this dataset. Users are provided with various forms of interaction (including mouseover tooltip, checkbox and list box) to investigate the detailed information they may be interested in.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Annotations</h2>
	<p>Annotations are used in all scenes, tooltip is provided by mouse-over action. By hovering above the nodes, bars and arcs, users can get detailed information.</p>
	<p></p>          
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
	<p>The navigation bar on top works as the parameter to help users move among scenes. Additionally, in scene 2, the year buttons below the chart used as parameter to filter the data, this enable the users to investigate crime type percentages for each year and compare between years.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Triggers</h2>
	<p>Clicking different tabs on the navigation bar triggers the navigation between scenes. The mouseover/mousemove action works as trigger for tooltips in all four scenes. By clicking year buttons in scene 2, the users trigger data filtering action based on year.</p>
    <p>To conclude, those interactive design embedded in the charts enhances narrative story telling for this visualization.</p>
